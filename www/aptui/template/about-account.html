	You don't need an account to give Apt a try! Many of the
	public profiles can be used without one - check out the list
	on the <a href="/">home page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	For accountability reasons, however, you will be limited in
	certain ways if you don't have an account. Users with a full
	account (free!) can use a larger set of profiles, can hold
	resources for longer, may request larger virtual machines and
	bare metal machines, and more. You will also need an account
	if you want to create profiles of your own.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you already have an account on Emulab.net, you may log in
	using that same acount on Aptlab.net.
