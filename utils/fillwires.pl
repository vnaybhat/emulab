# actual interface numbering (ie. the lowest numbered wire may not be eth0),

# node corresponds to eth3, the next to eth4, etc. There should be as many
# enries in this table as the number in experimental_interfaces variable above.
# Note that on the right side, there is no 2. This is because, with these nodes,
# eth2 is the control net.
